This tool is deprecated in favor of our new utility which directly reads bag data into Matlab and skips the conversion to CSV files. The new utility is available at: https://github.com/unl-nimbus-lab/bag2matlab.

bagReader.m reads data on a requested topic from a ROS bag file on a given topic. This requires ROS to be installed so that the Python helper function can load the ROS utilities for manipulating ROS bag files.
